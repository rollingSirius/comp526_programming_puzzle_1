## Impossibility

### Problem transformation
This problem can be transformed to determine the upper bound of the guaranteed harvest.

### Approach
Assume the upper bound is the sum of all growth rates in the list, and f(x) represents the guaranteed harvest. 

G represents the growth rate of the i<sub>th</sub> bamboo and there are k bamboos, then:

$$
f(x) < {\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^{k}} G_{i} 
$$

To achieve a guaranteed harvest equal to the sum of all growth rates, the growth rate for each bamboo should be:

$$
G_{i} = G_{avg} =  \frac{{\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^{k}} G_{i}}{k} 
$$

However, in any given list of growth rates, the rates are distinct and in descending order. This means:

$$
\neg \exists i \in \left \{1,2,3...,k\right \} :G_{i} = G_{avg}
$$

Therefore, for all provided growth rate lists, there exists an upper bound for the guaranteed harvest, which is:

$$
f(x) = o({\textstyle \sum_{i=1}^{k}} G_{i} )
$$

### Conclusion
In conclusion, it is impossible for the guaranteed daily harvest to equal the sum of all growth rates for the given bamboo plots.
